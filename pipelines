# Every line is one 'pipeline' that may produce several outputs.
# The *_done files indicate whether pipeline has been executed.
# These marker files are necessary since otherwise GNU make would
# run certain processes multiple times and far more often that necessary.

# marker files indicate whether pipeline has been executed
